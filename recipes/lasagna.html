        <h2> Ingredient list! </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Cheese Filling </li>
            <p>For this <em> classic </em> lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese. </p>
            <li> Meat </li>
            <p> I use <em> both </em> Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage. </p>
            <li> Sauce </li> 
            <p> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor. </p>
            <li> Spinach <em>variation</em></li>
            <p>Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer. </p>
        </ul>
